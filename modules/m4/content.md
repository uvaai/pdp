### Lectures

There are three scheduled lectures for this module:

* **Organizing code, duplicate code prevention** on *Tuesday September 28th at 13:00* in room G3.02

* **Linear regression & Partial derivatives** on *Wednesday September 29th at 11:00*: <https://uva-live.zoom.us/j/85073960902>

* **Gradient checking & Gradient descent** on *Thursday September 30th at 13:00* in room G2.10

### Online morning meetings

For the students working from home, there will be a morning meeting organised
every day at **09:00** where you can start your day together. You can join the
meeting at
[Wonder.me](https://www.wonder.me/r?id=c6cdcb4d-7901-44dc-9b9f-fe90898c22a5).

There you can discuss planning for the day and potenially find other students
that be starting the same part of an assignment as you, so you can
then decide to take a look at your approach for a problem together.
