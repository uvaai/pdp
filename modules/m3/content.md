### Lectures

There are two scheduled lectures for this module:

* **Bayes' Rule & the Naive Bayes algorithm** on *Tuesday September 21st at 11:00* in room F2.04

* **Code design** on *Thursday September 23rd at 13:00* in room G1.18

### Online morning meetings

For the students working from home, there will be a morning meeting organised
every day at **09:00** where you can start your day together. You can join the
meeting at
[Wonder.me](https://www.wonder.me/r?id=c6cdcb4d-7901-44dc-9b9f-fe90898c22a5).

There you can discuss planning for the day and potenially find other students
that be starting the same part of an assignment as you, so you can
then decide to take a look at your approach for a problem together.
