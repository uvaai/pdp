# Overview of basic tools

Python is a high level programming language. That means that it contains a lot of
tools that can solve very specific problems. Not all languages have all those tools,
and you don't need them.

This page gives an overview of all the most universal (basic) tools in Python.
Those are the (low-level) programming concepts that, in some form or another, exist
in almost *any* programming language, not just Python.

With combining the concepts below in the right way you can, in theory, write *any* program.
In fact, you don't even need all of them. In theory, only a small subset would suffice.


#### Operators

- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`: [theory](/python/en/basics#operators)
- `=`: [theory](/python/en/basics#variables)
