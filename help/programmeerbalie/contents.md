# Helpdesk (Programmeerbalie)
This page is specifically for the Helpdesk, not for the lab sessions. You can make an appointment for the helpdesk and join us on Science Park or online. With the helpdesk:

* Help is both available on campus (at Science Park) or online.
* Help is available on many moments throughout the week.

## Book a slot
Whether you join online or join on campus, in both cases **you have to make an appointment**. You can make an appointment *up to one day ahead*, using this link: [book a slot](https://balie.mprog.nl/planner/5-mcs-python-for-data-processing)

When you book a slot, clearly indicate if you plan to join "on campus" or "online".
