### Seminars

There are two scheduled seminars for this module

* **Introduction, Installation, terminal/editor basics and checkpy** on *Monday February 1st at 11:00*: <https://uva-live.zoom.us/j/86316839659>

* **Where to start; how to decompose a problem** on *Wednesday February 3rd at 11:00*: <https://uva-live.zoom.us/j/88403339641>

### Daily sessions

These will be organised every day. The first session will be held on *Tuesday* this module, as Monday is the kick-off day.

* Morning meetings at **09:00** on [Wonder.me](https://www.wonder.me/r?id=c6cdcb4d-7901-44dc-9b9f-fe90898c22a5)

* Question Queue at **09:30** on [Discord](https://discord.gg/jYqmkD8yXx)

## Algorithms

In this module you'll dip your toes into the water by implementing a few algorithms. These algorithms generate different outputs depending on what we provide as input. Seen that way, the algorithms are *generic*, albeit limited a particular kind of input. This module should be accessible with a high-school level background in mathematics.

But first, check out the short movie below. Egge van der Poel is a data scientist at the Erasmus MC Hospital en tells about his experience with programming and processing data from real patients.
