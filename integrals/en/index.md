**The deadline for both Data Processing and Introduction to Machine Learning is 17:59 on monday 15/02.**


In this module we'll get to work with *functions* and *random numbers*. With these Python components we can implement methdos that can determine the integral of just about any function! You don't need to have done any calculus to partake in this module, but some intuition with mathematical functions is quite relevant.

In the video below, meet Lydia Brenner and Jelle Aalbers from [Nikhef](http://www.nikhef.nl/) who tell you about their experiences with programming simulations for their research.
