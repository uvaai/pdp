# Dictionaries

This week we'll do a very short introduction on *dictionaries*. This
data structure comes already built into Python and is very often useful. We'll
go much more into detail on why and when it useful in a couple of weeks, but
for now we'll just going to cover the very basics of how to use it. Watch the
video below, and then make the exercises in the notebook.

*You do not need to hand in your solution for this assignment.* The assignment
is only meant as _practice_, as you'll need to use a dictionary for the
*Introduction to Machine Learning 1* assignment this week. _**You do not need to use dictionaries in your solution for Monte Carlo or Big Data.**_
